20/07/25 Best talk award for **Eleonora Marcantoni**! Eleonora Marcantoni was awarded the Best Talk Prize at MEG UKI 2025, held in London this July. Her talk, "Enhancing memory in humans via MEG-closed-loop Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation (RSS) tuned to the frequency of hippocampal theta oscillations", presented exciting new results on the feasibility of detecting deep brain activity using non-invasive neuroimaging methods. Congratulations Ele!

06/12/24 Successfull Grant Application! **We got a project grant from the Bial foundation together with [Cassandra Sampaio-Baptista](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychologyneuroscience/staff/cassandrasampaiobaptista/).** The aims of the project are to investigate whether extended multi-sensory rhythmic stimulation induces changes in behaviour, brain structure, and brain function in humans consistent with a prominent plasticity mechanism (Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity). Exciting times ahead for the Sampaio-Baptista and Hanslmayr labs!
